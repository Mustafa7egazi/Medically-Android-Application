# Medically-Application
My android course project for second semester of third year in FCI.
A local android app for registeration of patients consultation in a clinic.
Doctor can register a new account or sign in with his existing account.
As soon as the doctor logged in, he can add a new patient to his list, explore all patients at his list, and delete data of a patient and more.
All these functionalty depend on SQLite database and SharedPreferences as local storage.
I will work on improving this app while gaining more knowledge insha'allah.
